## Collaboration and Competition project

#### Introduction

This project uses Deep Reinforcement Learning to train a pair of agents to control 2 tennis rackets in the environment shown below.
The goal is to pass the ball over the net back and forth, without letting it drop to the ground or go out of bounds.
